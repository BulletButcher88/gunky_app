# Band Controller App

### Setup

Clone the code, and open index.html on a liver server though VSC.


# Mission Statment

The idea sprung from wanting to make a music app, with Andrew (collaborator), myself and my brother all interested in improvised bands, My brother Ben suggested I make an app that will help his band have a little structure, something that gives some control to the audience. 

I've designed a controller that allows a client to select a tempo, the keynote that the group is to play in, style of changes, and a stop and start option. 

I plan on making three versions of the contorller. The other two will be more basic display cards, with less options to this version. 

## NEXT STEPS

* Build a server and route to handle the queue cards from remote client to display client

* Test drive the app with a band. Get some feedback and make changes.

* Setup authentication code to link with server port. 

* Deploy using: https://surge.sh/
