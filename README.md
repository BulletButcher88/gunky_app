# Gunky Funky APP

# Mission Statment
## app for the audience to conducting a band

My brother is currently in a great little psychedelic funk band, a noisy group, lots of rowdy moments. 

He made the suggestion of an orchestrator app placing some control in the hands of a person in the audience... allowing them to set a tempo, the key the group is to play in, style or changes, and stop, start or pause.

## NEXT STEPS

##1 Researching socket.io and WebSockets for two clients talk to each other.
Open up for collaboration on the project - Andy Simms, a classmate has shown interest.

##2 Find collaborators in building the app. A classmate Andy Simms seems pretty keen to get work together on it.

##3 Test drive the app with a band. Get some feedback and make changes or pivot.

##4 Make the description text editable for users. 

When ready to deploy, I hope to try: https://surge.sh/
