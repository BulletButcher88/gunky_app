# Gunky Funky APP

# Mission Statment
## app for the audience to conducting a band

My brother Ben is currently in a great little psychedelic funk band, improvised and noisy, with some rowdy moments. 

He made the suggestion of an orchestrator app placing some control in the hands of a person in the audience... allowing them to set a tempo, the key the group is to play in, style or changes, and stop, start or pause.

NEXT STEP: establish connective clients via a server, using express or maybe socket.io

Andy Simms, has made a server.js file that we are yet to impliment. 

Mark Btucher, almost finalised in making the controller and band page ready for connectivity
