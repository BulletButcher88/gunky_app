# Gunky Funky APP

# Mission Statment
## app for the audience to conducting a band

My brother is currently in a great little psychedelic funk band, a noisy group, lots of rowdy moments. 

He made the suggestion of an orchestrator app placing some control in the hands of a person in the audience... allowing them to set a tempo, the key the group is to play in, style or changes, and stop, start or pause.

NEXT STEP: researching socket.io and WebSockets for two clients talk to each other.
Open up for collaboration on the project - Andy Simms, a classmate has shown interest.
