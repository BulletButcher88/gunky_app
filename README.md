# Gunky Funky App

# Mission Statment
## app to conducting a band with

My brother is in a nice little psychedelic funk band. They're a noisy group, lots of rowdy moments and almost all improvised.

He suggested I make an app helps them have a little structure, and gives some control to the audience. A controller can let them select a tempo, the key the group is to play in, style of changes, stop, start or pause. 

At the moment is just a testing page with a remote button opening to a client control browers and a clock to help with a tempo button. 

## NEXT STEPS

* Researching socket.io and WebSockets for two clients talk to each other.
Open up for collaboration on the project - Andy Simms, a classmate has shown interest.

* Find collaborators in building the app. A classmate Andy Simms seems pretty keen to get work together on it.

* Test drive the app with a band. Get some feedback and make changes or pivot.

* Make the description text editable for users. 

When ready to deploy, I hope to try: https://surge.sh/
