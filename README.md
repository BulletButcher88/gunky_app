# Gunky Funky APP

# Mission Statment
## app for the audience to conducting a band

My brother is in a nice little psychedelic funk band. They're a noisy group, lots of rowdy moments, but its almost all improvised.

He made the suggested an orchestrator app, that places some control in the hands in the audience... allowing them to set a tempo, the key the group is to play in, style or changes, and stop, start or pause. 

The app at the moment is just a testing page, with a remote button, opening up a for a control client.

## NEXT STEPS

* Researching socket.io and WebSockets for two clients talk to each other.
Open up for collaboration on the project - Andy Simms, a classmate has shown interest.

* Find collaborators in building the app. A classmate Andy Simms seems pretty keen to get work together on it.

* Test drive the app with a band. Get some feedback and make changes or pivot.

* Make the description text editable for users. 

When ready to deploy, I hope to try: https://surge.sh/
